#React ES6 boilerplate

This boilerplate uses
+ ImmutableJS
+ Babel
+ Flummox
+ SASS (can easily be changed to other preprocessors)
+ Webpack with React hot loader
+ ESlint

To run this server do the following
```
npm install
npm start
```
If you like Makefiles
```
make bootstrap
make run
```

This is a work in progress. Missing features are
+ [ ] Build process for app
+ [ ] A bit nicer UI for the demo app
